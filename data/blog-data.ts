# Building Performant React Applications with Next.js 15

Next.js 15 introduces powerful new features that make building fast, modern web applications easier than ever. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the key improvements and best practices.

## The Power of Server Components

Server Components revolutionize how we think about React applications. By rendering components on the server, we can:

- Reduce JavaScript bundle sizes dramatically
- Fetch data closer to the source
- Improve initial page load times
- Enhance SEO and social sharing

\`\`\`tsx
// app/page.tsx
async function HomePage() {
  const posts = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts');
  const data = await posts.json();
  
  return (
    <div>
      {data.map(post => (
        <PostCard key={post.id} post={post} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
\`\`\`

## Streaming and Suspense

Streaming allows you to progressively render UI as data becomes available, improving perceived performance.

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 provides incredible tools for building fast, scalable applications. Start experimenting today!

# Mastering Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS has transformed how we approach styling. Let's explore advanced techniques that will elevate your projects.

## Custom Design Tokens

Creating a consistent design system with Tailwind is straightforward:

\`\`\`js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: '#0ea5e9',
        secondary: '#8b5cf6'
      }
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Component Composition

Build reusable components with the @apply directive and CSS modules for better organization.
